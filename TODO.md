# TODO

## Completed

## In Progress

- Barcode scanning/POS workflow: ability to scan a barcode or manually enter a bike # to look it up and ring it up in Shopify POS.

## Not Started

- Figure out barcode scanning/POS ringing up workflow. Want to scan the bike barcode and have it ring up in POS, or manually enter bike # if needed.

## Future Features

- A "in transit" page & status for bikes that are on the way to us but haven't arrived yet. This would be a place to keep track of the bikes we have ordered but haven't received, and it would help us plan for when they will arrive and how many we will have in stock. I will just upload the invoice and then it will be stored in the "in transit" page until the bikes arrive, at which point I can move them to the "in stock" page.
