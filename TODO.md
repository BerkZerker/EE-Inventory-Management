# TODO

## Completed

## In Progress

- Barcodes: creation is done (Code128 labels via barcode_generator.py, Avery 5160 sheets + thermal labels). **Still needed:** scanning/ringing up workflow — ability to scan a barcode or manually enter a bike # to look it up and ring it up in Shopify POS.

- UI cleanup: Inventory page groups by Brand > Model > Variants with collapsible rows, shows cost/retail/bike#. **Still needed:** hide SKU on Products page, add wholesale price display.

- Overall UI clarity: modern sidebar layout, status badges, card-based design in place. **Still needed:** mobile responsiveness, better visual hierarchy.

## Not Started

- Figure out barcode scanning/POS ringing up workflow. Want to scan the bike barcode and have it ring up in POS, or manually enter bike # if needed.

## Future Features

- A "in transit" page & status for bikes that are on the way to us but haven't arrived yet. This would be a place to keep track of the bikes we have ordered but haven't received, and it would help us plan for when they will arrive and how many we will have in stock. I will just upload the invoice and then it will be stored in the "in transit" page until the bikes arrive, at which point I can move them to the "in stock" page.

- Make the UI more user-friendly and visually appealing. This could include things like adding images of the bikes, using color coding to indicate different brands or models, and making it easier to navigate between different pages and sections of the app. Using hyperlinks so I can just click on products, get our brand colors set up, and just generally make it more visually appealing and easier to use including on mobile devices & overall navigation.
