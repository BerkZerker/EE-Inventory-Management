# TODO

- Products need to show up in POINT OF SALE sales channel in Shopify.

- Figure out how barcodes (creation) & scanning (ringing up) will work. I want to be able to just scan the bike and have it ring up in the POS, but I also want to be able to manually enter the bike # if needed.

- Set up a way to enter current inventory manually so I can get the app up and running with our current stock. This could be a simple form where I can enter the bike #, brand, model, variant, and quantity for each bike we have in stock. I also need to be able to set what bike # we are currently at, instead of starting from 0.

- Make the UI cleaner - I want to be able to just see the brands and the bikes, and how many for each variant. I don't need to see the sku, just our cost, wholesale, & bike #.

- The parsing needs to get cleaned up - I just want to autofill the brand, model, and variant from the title. Stuff about fenders, wholesale, and such can be ignored.

- Overall work on UI to make it more clear and easy to understand & use.

## Future Features

- A "in transit" page & status for bikes that are on the way to us but haven't arrived yet. This would be a place to keep track of the bikes we have ordered but haven't received, and it would help us plan for when they will arrive and how many we will have in stock. I will just upload the invoice and then it will be stored in the "in transit" page until the bikes arrive, at which point I can move them to the "in stock" page.

- Make the UI more user-friendly and visually appealing. This could include things like adding images of the bikes, using color coding to indicate different brands or models, and making it easier to navigate between different pages and sections of the app. Using hyperlinks so I can just click on products, get our brand colors set up, and just generally make it more visually appealing and easier to use including on mobile devices & overall navigation.
